> **Instructions for running the project:**

> - After downloading and extracting the zip provided on our post, open terminal/command prompt and go to the folder directory.
> - Now type "npm start" command. Be patient, as webpack bundled takes little time to get packed all files.
> > **npm start** 

> - Once webpack bundled gets completed, the server will run on the port defined in webpack.config.js file.
> - You can change the port whatever you want(in our case, we have set the default port to 3000), if its conflicting with other projects on your system.
> - Now hit the link http://localhost:3000 on browser.
> - Whenever you save any file after changes(in development mode), it will automatically restart the server and reload the browser as because we are running the server with hot deployment.
